# License Management

{% hint style="info" %}
DeviceOn’s license management system allows you to manage your own licenses. These licenses are used to activate and bind the number of devices that can be managed by the DeviceOn server. In this system, you can transfer licenses to other users. You can also freely split a single license into multiple licenses. For example, if you have 1 license for 100 devices, you can split this into 10 licenses for 10 devices each. The minimum unit is 1 device.



Additionally, you can bind multiple licenses to a single DeviceOn server.

* The license system lets you manage licenses
* Licenses activate and limit device connections
* You can transfer licenses between users
* You can split a license into smaller licenses
* Smallest license is for 1 device
* Supports binding multiple licenses to one server
