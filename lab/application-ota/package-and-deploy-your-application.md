# Package and Deploy your Application

**App Store** is another powerful feature DeviceOn provides. Users can install software application onto a device remotely, or even many devices broadly. This lab guides you how to accomplish upload and wrap your application to on-premises App Store. And, after this lab, you should:

* Learn how to wrap your software for remote provisioning.
* Have the NotePad++, a popular and famous text editor, populated within the target device.

## Prerequisite <a href="#prerequisite" id="prerequisite"></a>

* A running DeviceOn server.
* A device which running on Windows operating system and installed DeviceOn Agent, that connects to DeviceOn server.
* Every files are required for installation. Such as installer, binary files, also including necessary dependencies. In this lab, taking Notepad++ for demo. A NotePad++ installer, 32-bit edition is recommended. Its name is “**npp.7.8.2.Installer.exe**”, something like that. It can be downloaded from [**https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Automation skills to install target software package**</mark>**.** It is because that user intervention is not possible during provisioning via App Store. For Windows it can be batch file or power shell, while for Ubuntu it may be shell scripts.

## Example

* [Notepad++ on Windows](https://eiot.blob.core.windows.net/deviceon/Material/OTA/Windows%20Npp.zip)
* [Chrome on Linux](https://eiot.blob.core.windows.net/deviceon/Material/OTA/Linux%20Google%20Chrome.zip)&#x20;
* [BIOS Update SOP](https://eiot.blob.core.windows.net/deviceon/Material/OTA/BIOS\_Update\_TOP%20SWAP.pdf)
