It is preset that each device will automatically upload some sensors every **60s**, which is mainly used to analyze the health status of the device, such as HDD healthy, network usage. BTW, you could **batch apply the setting to other devices**.

Please make sure that the applicable devices have the same sensors in order for the data to be properly applied and uploaded effectively.
