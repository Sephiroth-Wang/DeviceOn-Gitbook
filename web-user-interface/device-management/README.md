# Device Management

After onboarding a device, the DeviceOn allows you to:

* View and edit basic device information in the **Device List** page, including name, upgrade status, power state, etc.
* See current device load and set threshold-based rules through the Rule Engine (hardware and software) in the **Device Monitoring** section
* Remotely control and troubleshoot devices through **Remote Control**
* Access all sensor data streams in **Device Data**
* Logically group devices via **Device Groups**
* Schedule remote batch tasks on devices using **Task** Definitions
* Configure advanced functionality like WoL, backups, protection in **Device Provisioning**
* Use AI to detect device display anomalies via **Anomaly Detection**
