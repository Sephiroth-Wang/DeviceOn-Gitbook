## 2FA Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you must log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to. If you prefer to use an authenticator app for two-step verification, here are a few common authenticator apps that can be found in your mobile device app store:

* Google Authenticator
* Microsoft Authenticator
* Authy
* LastPass Authenticator
