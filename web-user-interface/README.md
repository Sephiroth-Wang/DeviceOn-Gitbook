### View Upgrade Details

This item will only show up if you have an older version of the Agent (**below v1.4.50**) installed on your system. Because older Agents use **OpenSSL version 1.x**, which is explicitly not supported in **RabbitMQ 3.13**, it is recommended that you upgrade these Agents as soon as possible to avoid potential security issues.

The device list here only displays versions lower than v1.4.50. You can upgrade or delete devices that are currently online. For devices that are not online, you can decide if they are no longer being managed and delete them.&#x20;

Note that deleting a device removes all data from that device, including the connection information.
