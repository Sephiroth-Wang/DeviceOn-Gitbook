# ISA/IEC 62443

## What's IEC 62443

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62443 comprises a collection of cybersecurity standards specifically designed for safeguarding industrial automation and control systems (IACS). This comprehensive framework encompasses various sections that address the critical aspects of securing automation and control systems in terms of processes and technological considerations.&#x20;

Within the IEC 62443 standard, security topics are categorized based on the stakeholders and their respective roles, which include IACS product manufacturers, service providers, and operators. It is imperative for individuals and organizations fulfilling these roles to adhere to the recommended risk-based approach in order to effectively prevent and mitigate security risks.

## A Breakdown of the IEC 62443 Standards

There are four parts to the IEC 62443 standards. The first part covers common topics for the whole standards series. The second part covers IACS security processes and techniques. The third part defines system-level requirements, while the fourth part details IACS product and component requirements.

The standards propose a cybersecurity management system (CSMS) with the following elements:&#x20;

* Initial risk assessment and prioritization.&#x20;
* Detailed technical risk assessment.&#x20;
* Creation of security policies.&#x20;
* Identification and implementation of countermeasures.&#x20;
* Maintenance of the CSMS program.

Here is a brief outline of the key IEC 62433 standards:

* IEC 62443-1-1 defines IACS security concepts and terminology.
* IEC 62443-2-1 defines the necessary elements for an IACS program and CSMS, offering recommendations for achieving these elements.
* IEC 62443-2-3 addresses security for IACS vendors with IACS patch management programs. It recommends a format for sharing security patch information, although it is also useful for other updates and patches unrelated to security.
* IEC 62443-2-4 addresses security capabilities that IACS service providers must offer asset owners when integrating and maintaining the solution.
* IEC 62443-3-1 covers IACS security technologies, including available tools and mitigation measures. It assesses these security controls, their benefits and drawbacks for securing critical infrastructure environments.
* IEC 62443-3-2 shows how to define a System Under Consideration (SUC), which is a regulated AICS system. This definition involves breaking up the regulated system into units called conduits and zones, making it easier to assess risks to different parts of the system. In addition, this standard specifies how to design, implement, and operate an IACS system using security best practices and standard engineering practices, identify risks to the system, and apply countermeasures.
* IEC 62443-3-3 defines technical control system requirements related to the foundational requirements outlined in IEC 62443-1-1. These requirements are useful for various IACS stakeholders. End-users can apply them to an integrated IACS or leverage an automated solution.
* IEC 62443-4-1 defines the requirements for building secure IACS products and components, including secure development lifecycle requirements. It recommends security requirements including secure coding and patch management guidelines.
* IEC 62443-4-2 defines technical requirements for control system components. Each component can reach a certain security level, based on the requirements the organization chose to implement.

## What Does IEC 62443 Mean for IoT Security?

The IEC 62443 standard applies to many types of devices, but it is highly relevant for internet of things (IoT) devices. Let’s take a closer look at two sub-standards that have a major impact on regulated IoT devices.

### IEC 62443-4-1 (Secure Development Lifecycle)

This standard specifies requirements to ensure a secure development process for products used in an industrial automation and control system. IEC 62443-4-1 defines the cybersecurity requirements for a security development lifecycle (SDL), with guidance to help companies meet these requirements. The SDL includes the following elements:

* Defining the security requirements&#x20;
* Designing secure systems Implementing security (includes coding guidelines)&#x20;
* Verifying and validating the implementation&#x20;
* Managing defects and patches&#x20;
* Handling the end of the product life cycle

These requirements may apply to new or established processes to develop, maintain, or retire software, hardware, and firmware.

### IEC 62443-4-2 (Technical System Component Requirements)

This standard provides technical component requirements (CRs) for control systems. It relates to the FRs (foundational requirements) defined in IEC 62443-1-1, defining requirements for achieving the security levels of the control system and its components (SL-C).

The 7 FRs defined in IEC TS 62443-1-1 are:

* Identification and Authentication Control&#x20;
* Use Control
* System Integrity&#x20;
* Data Confidentiality&#x20;
* Restricted Data Flow&#x20;
* Timely Response to Events&#x20;
* Resource Availability

These FRs form the basis for defining the security capability levels of a control system. This standard’s purpose is to define each component’s security capability levels.

### Compliance Challenges for IoT Devices

Achieving IEC 62443 compliance for Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a complex, layered process. The following are two key challenges your organization will probably face when addressing them.

#### Implementing Security Controls for Communication Networks

IEC 62443-4-2 focuses on establishing and maintaining the security of industrial automation and control system (IACS) networks. Compliance with this standard requires implementing specific security controls for communication networks within IoT devices. This includes measures such as network segmentation, access controls, secure remote access, and intrusion detection systems. The challenge lies in integrating these security controls seamlessly into the IoT device's network architecture, ensuring that communication between different components and systems is secure and protected against unauthorized access or tampering. Organizations must carefully design and configure their IoT devices to comply with the requirements of IEC 62443-4-2 while maintaining seamless connectivity and functionality.

#### Ensuring Secure Development and Testing Processes

IEC 62443-4-2 emphasizes the importance of secure development and testing practices for IoT devices. Compliance requires implementing secure coding practices, conducting security testing, and verifying the absence of known vulnerabilities in the device's software and firmware. Organizations must establish robust development and testing processes that incorporate security from the initial stages of design and continue throughout the device's lifecycle. This includes conducting vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and address potential security weaknesses. The challenge lies in integrating security practices into the development and testing workflows, ensuring that all personnel involved understand and follow secure coding guidelines and that the necessary tools and resources are available to support secure development and testing activities.&#x20;

Addressing these compliance challenges requires a holistic approach that combines technical expertise, process improvements, and organizational commitment to security. It is essential to have skilled personnel who understand the requirements of IEC 62443-4-2 and can effectively implement the necessary security controls. Furthermore, organizations should establish secure development practices, provide adequate training and resources for developers and testers, and incorporate security testing into the device's development lifecycle. Regular audits and assessments can help ensure ongoing compliance with IEC 62443-4-2 and the security of IoT devices in industrial environments.
