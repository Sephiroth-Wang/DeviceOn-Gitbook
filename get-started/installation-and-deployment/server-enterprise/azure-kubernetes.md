# Azure Kubernetes

This document tries to describe, and guide you, how to deploy DeviceOn on Azure cloud. The version is focused on Azure components to integrate to provide security, scalability and high availability.

Microsoft Azure provides lot’s of cloud services with security, scalability and high available. Based on Azure components, DeviceOn could focus on functionalities for device management and data acquisition. We fully integrate with below services:

* Azure Application Gateway (WAF protection and traffic load balancer), Optional
* Kubernetes (Container Management)
* Azure AD (Authentication), Optional
* Cosmos DB, Azure PostgreSQL (Database)
* Azure Function, IoTHub (Secure Device Connection)
* Stream Analytics, Event Hub, Service Bus (Message Bus and Filter)

When you build on Azure’s secure foundation, you accelerate your move to the cloud by achieving compliance more readily, allowing you to enable privacy-sensitive cloud scenarios, such as financial and health service, with confidence.

## Prerequisites

To achieve the goal to deploy DeviceOn, some resources have to be acquired and preconditions must be met as well.

* An active Azure subscription.
* An **Azure CLI** installed on your laptop, please refer to [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-tw/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to download and setup. The Azure CLI is available to install in Windows, macOS and Linux environments. It can also be run in a Docker container and Azure Cloud Shell.

Second option, if you don’t want to install Azure CLI, you can also adopt **Azure Cloud Shell**, please refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

## Step 1: **Obtain the following three parameters for deployment**

* Application ID
* Password (Client Secrets)
* Tenant ID

1. **Sign into your Azure account through Azure CLI**

> Use any way you prefer to open a Command Prompt and enter

```bash
az login
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load a sign-in page. Otherwise, you need to open a browser page and follow the instructions on the command line to enter an authorization code after navigating to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) in your browser. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
{% endhint %}

2. **Select your Subscription**

> After you login, the terminal console will list all subscriptions, please select the subscription that you would like to deploy.

```bash
az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
```

> If you don’t know which subscriptions you have, you can use below command to list all the subscriptions, and determine whether the subscription has been selected according to **isDefault**.

```bash
az account list --output table
```

3. **Create a service principal**

> The last step to create a service principal and generate these parameters. (**1. Application ID**, **2. Password** and **3. Tenant ID**)

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --role "owner"
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> If you want to further limit the scope of service principle to resource group, please try to create the resource group, and then use the following command to limit.

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME --role "owner" --scopes /subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup1}
```

## Step 2: **Deploy DeviceOn via Custom Template**

1. Open the Azure Portal

> This will open the Azure Portal ([portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/)) in your subscription and create the required resources.

5\. **Deployment Process**

> The entire deployment process takes about **30 minutes**. After completion, you will receive a mail notification. The content of the mail includes the DeviceOn web _Service IP_ and login **Account password**.

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LNQrNOS.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Assuming that your mail is intercepted/block or not received due to mail server filters, we will synchronously write this information to the **Azure Blob Log** container. Go to your **resource group** (you entered at the stage of deployment) **storage account -> container -> Log -> ServerInformation.log**. If the container has not been created, please wait a few minutes for initialization.

6. **Result**

> There are two resource group generated on your subscription, one is you entered at the stage of deployment, which include the services such as: AKS, IoTHub, EventHub, Stream Analytics, CosmosDB, PostgreSQL…etc. Another resource group name prefix name starts with **MC**, that contains AKS VM node.
